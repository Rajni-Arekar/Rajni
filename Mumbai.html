The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of Marathi language-speaking Koli people.
 For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza in her marriage to Charles II of England.[28] Beginning in 1782, Mumbai was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[29] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the Arabian Sea.[30] Along with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea.
